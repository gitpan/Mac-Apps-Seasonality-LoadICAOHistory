Mac::Apps::Seasonality::LoadICAOHistory version 0.0.5

Seasonality (http://gauchosoft.com/Software/Seasonality/) is a weather
tracking and display application for MacOS X.  This module provides a means of
getting data into Seasonality that it cannot retrieve on its own.

Mac::Apps::Seasonality::LoadICAOHistory is designed to handle data that has
already been converted into Perl data structures.

There is an additional module, Mac::Apps::Seasonality::LoadICAOHistoryFromCSV,
which parses data in CSV (Comma Separated Values) format and feeds it to
Mac::Apps::Seasonality::LoadICAOHistory.

Finally, there is a command-line tool, load_seasonality_history, that deals
with the Seasonality application itself and handing files into
Mac::Apps::Seasonality::LoadICAOHistoryFromCSV.  This program will take
advantage of Growl (http://growl.info/), if the Mac::Growl module is installed,
but this is not required.

At present, the requirements for the input data are very strict and said data
must conform very closely to what ends up in the database.  Future versions
will be more lenient.

This module is very early early in its development.  Don't consider any of the
interfaces of this module to be stable.
