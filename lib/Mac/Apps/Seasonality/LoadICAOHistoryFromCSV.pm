=head1 NAME

Mac::Apps::Seasonality::LoadICAOHistoryFromCSV - Load data from a CSV file
into Seasonality's database.


=head1 VERSION

This document describes Mac::Apps::Seasonality::LoadICAOHistoryFromCSV version
0.0.5.


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use English qw{ -no_match_vars };
    use Fatal qw{ open close read write };
    use IO::File;
    use DBI;
    use Mac::Apps::Seasonality::LoadICAOHistoryFromCSV qw{ &load_icao_history_from_csv_handle };
    use Mac::Apps::Seasonality::Exceptions;

    my $file_handle = IO::File->new('data.csv', 'r');

    my $database_connection =
        DBI->connect(
            "dbi:SQLite2:$database_file_name",
            q{},
            q{},
            {
                AutoCommit => 0,

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides functions for reading ICAO data from comma separated values (CSV)
files.


=head1 INTERFACE

=over

=item C<load_icao_history_from_csv_handle($database_connection, $io_handle, %options)>

Takes a reference to a DBI handle and to an I/O handle referring to data in
CSV format and loads the data from the handle into the database.

C<$database_connection> must be an open handle to an SQLite2 database with
Seasonality's schema.  This handle must have the RaiseError option set on it;
this module does no error checking of database actions on its own.

C<$io_handle> must be an open handle to data in CSV format, with the data on
each line in the order described in the documentation for
L<Mac::Apps::Seasonality::LoadICAOHistory/"load_icao_history">.  No checking
is done for I/O errors, so the use of the Fatal module is highly suggested.
The data read from this handle must not contain anything other than the actual
data to be loaded.  In particular, this means that there cannot be any column
headers.

If no problems are encountered, the number of data points loaded is returned.

A Mac::Apps::Seasonality::CSVParseException is thrown if the raw input cannot
be turned into the module's internal representation.

A Mac::Apps::Seasonality::InvalidDatumException is thrown if an individual
value does not fit the constraints required by Seasonality.


B<Options:>

=over

=item C<clean>

A boolean value indicating whether
L<Mac::Apps::Seasonality::LoadICAOHistory/"clean_icao_history_set"> should be
invoked after reading the file but before actually loading the data.

=item C<clean_message_handle>

A reference to a file handle to write any messages about cleaned up data to.
If C<clean> is specified, but this is not, then the data will still be cleaned
but there be no indication of any problems found emitted.
