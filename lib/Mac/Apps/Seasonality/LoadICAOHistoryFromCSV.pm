=head1 NAME

Mac::Apps::Seasonality::LoadICAOHistoryFromCSV - Load data from a CSV file into
Seasonality's database.


=head1 VERSION

This document describes Mac::Apps::Seasonality::LoadICAOHistoryFromCSV
version 0.0.4.


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use English qw{ -no_match_vars };
    use Fatal qw{ open close read write };
    use IO::File;
    use DBI;
    use Mac::Apps::Seasonality::LoadICAOHistoryFromCSV
        qw{ load_icao_history_from_csv_handle };
    use Mac::Apps::Seasonality::Exceptions;

    my $file_handle = IO::File->new('data.csv', 'r');

    my $database_connection =
        DBI->connect(
            "dbi:SQLite2:$database_file_name",
            q{},
            q{},
            {
                AutoCommit => 0,
                RaiseError => 1,
            }
        );

    eval { load_icao_history_from_csv_handle($database_connection, $file_handle) };

    my $exception
    if ($exception = Mac::Apps::Seasonality::CSVParseException->caught()) {
        ...
    } elsif ($exception = Mac::Apps::Seasonality::InvalidDatumException->caught()) {
        ...
    } elsif ($EVAL_ERROR) {
        ...
    } # end if


=head1 DESCRIPTION

=for author to fill in:
    Write a full description of the module and its features here.
    Use subsections (=head2, =head3) as appropriate.


=head1 INTERFACE

=over

=item load_icao_history_from_csv_handle($database_connection, $io_handle)

Takes a reference to a DBI handle and to an I/O handle referring to data in CSV
format and loads the data from the handle into the database.

C<$database_connection> must be an open handle to an SQLite2 database with
Seasonality's schema.  This handle must have the RaiseError option set on it;
this module does no error checking of database actions on its own.

C<$io_handle> must be an open handle to data in CSV format, with the data on
each line in the order described in the documentation for
L<Mac::Apps::Seasonality::LoadICAOHistory/load_icao_history>.  No checking is
done for I/O errors, so the use of the Fatal module is highly suggested.  The
data read from this handle must not contain anything other than the actual data
to be loaded.  In particular, this means that there cannot be any column
headers.

If no problems are encountered, the number of data points loaded is returned.

A Mac::Apps::Seasonality::CSVParseException is thrown if the raw input cannot
be turned into the module's internal representation.

A Mac::Apps::Seasonality::InvalidDatumException is thrown if an individual
value does not fit the constraints required by Seasonality.
