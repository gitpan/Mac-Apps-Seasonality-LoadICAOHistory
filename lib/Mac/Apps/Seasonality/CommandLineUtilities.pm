=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a set of utilities for building applications which deal with
Seasonality.  All functions expect that C<initialize_program_utilities()> has
been called first.  Most functions will emit messages about what they're doing
via C<state_progress()>.  This behavior can be disabled by passing a true
value for the second parameter to C<initialize_program_utilities()>.  The
C<state_progress()> function emits messages to STDOUT and via Growl
notifications if L<Mac::Growl> is installed and the third parameter to
C<initialize_program_utilities()> is a true value.



=head1 INTERFACE

=over

=item C<$GROWL_NOTIFICATION_PROGRESS>

The progress notification for Growl, to be used as the second parameter to
L<Mac::Growl/"PostNotification"> in order to announce actions being taken by
the program.

=item C<$GROWL_NOTIFICATION_SEASONALITY_APPLICATION_STATUS>

The state of Seasonality notification for Growl, to be used as the second
parameter to L<Mac::Growl/"PostNotification"> in order to announce whether the
program thinks Seasonality is running or not.

=item C<$GROWL_NOTIFICATION_ERROR>

The error notification for Growl, to be used as the second parameter to
L<Mac::Growl/"PostNotification"> in order to announce problems found by the
program.

=item C<$GROWL_NOTIFICATIONS_REF>

A reference to an array containing C<$GROWL_NOTIFICATION_PROGRESS>,
C<$GROWL_NOTIFICATION_SEASONALITY_APPLICATION_STATUS>, and
C<$GROWL_NOTIFICATION_ERROR>.  This is useful for the second and third
parameters to L<Mac::Growl/"RegisterNotifications">.

=item C<$GROWL_APPLICATION_ICON>

The name of the icon to use for notifications.

=item C<initialize_program_utilities( $application_name, [ quiet =E<gt> $boolean, ] [ use_growl =E<gt> $boolean, ] )>

Saves the name of the application, tells C<state_progress()> whether to
actually emit anything and whether it should use Growl if it is available.
Also it initializes Growl if it is to be used.

No useful value is returned.


=item C<state_progress( $notification, $message )>

Emits messages to STDOUT and to Growl, if it is enabled.

The C<$notification> parameter should be one of
C<$GROWL_NOTIFICATION_PROGRESS>,
C<$GROWL_NOTIFICATION_SEASONALITY_APPLICATION_STATUS>, or
C<$GROWL_NOTIFICATION_ERROR> if Growl is being used.  In particular, if this
parameter is C<$GROWL_NOTIFICATION_ERROR>, the message will be emitted even if
the call to C<initialize_program_utilities()> stated that the application
should be quiet; also, if Growl is enabled, the notification will be sticky.

No useful value is returned.


=item C<shutdown_seasonality_if_necessary( [ no_shutdown =E<gt> $boolean, ] [ no_restart =E<gt> $boolean, ] [ force_start =E<gt> $boolean, ] [ shutdown_wait =E<gt> $seconds, ] )>

Shuts down Seasonality, if it is running, and gathers the information that
C<restart_seasonality_if_necessary()> needs.

If C<no_shutdown> is true, Seasonality will not be shut down, even if is
running.

If C<no_restart> is true, Seasonality will not be restarted by
C<restart_seasonality_if_necessary()>, even if it was running when this
function was called.

If C<force_start> is true, Seasonality will be started by
C<restart_seasonality_if_necessary()>, even if it wasn't running when this
function was called.  A true value for this parameter overrides the value of
C<no_restart>.

The value of C<shutdown_wait> is the number of seconds to wait for Seasonality
to stop, if it is going to be brought down.

No useful value is returned.

=head1 EXPORT TAGS

None of the above constants or functions are exported by default.  They have
to be individually imported, or you can use the following tags.

=over

=item C<:all>

Import everything.


=item C<:growl>

Import the C<$GROWL_*> constants.


=item C<:functions>

Import the functions.


=back


=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=over

=item C<< No application name was given to initialize_program_utilities(). >>

No arguments were given to C<initialize_program_utilities()> or the
application name was empty.


=item C<< Mac::Apps::Seasonality::CommandLineUtilities has not been initialized.  Call initialize_program_utilities() first. >>

A function in this package was invoked before
C<initialize_program_utilities()> was called.


=item C<< Could not shut down Seasonality: $EXTENDED_OS_ERROR >>

An attempt to stop a current Seasonality process failed for the specified
reason.


=item C<< "%s" does not exist as a writable file.  Will not create it. >>

A call was made to C<create_database_connection()> with the path to the
database not existing or not being writable.  All database files should be
created by Seasonality in order to ensure that it doesn't run into any
problems with them.


=item C<< Could not copy "%s" to "%s": $OS_ERROR >>

An attempt to back up the database failed.


=item C<< Could not open %s: $DBI::errstr >>

An attempt to open the database failed due to a problem discovered by the
database driver.
